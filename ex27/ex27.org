#+TITLE: Creative and Defensive Programming
* The Creative Programmer Mind-Set
+ I can't make a mistake.
+ It doesn't matter what people think.
+ Whatever my brain comes up with is going to be a great idea.
* The Defensive Programmer Mind-Set
+ Software has errors.
+ You aren't your software, yet you're responsible for the errors.
+ You can never remove the errors, only reduce their probability.


Actually I found it applies to ourselves; We are not perfect creature and has
errors on our outputs. We can never remove the errors on that output (or the
degree of our understanding).

So by being comfortable with those idea, the author assumed which applies to

* The Eight Defensive Programmer Strategies
+ Never Trust Input
+ Prevent Errors
+ Fail Early and Openly
+ Document Assumptions
+ Prevention over Documentation
+ Automate Everything
+ Simplify and Clarify
+ Question Authority
